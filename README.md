# Tr_He_in_Catchment
This juypter notebook simulates the entry, transport and radioactive decay of tritium in groundwater, and the corresponding so-called Tritium-Helium groundwater age. 

The atomic-bomb tests in the 1960ties released tritium into the atmoshere leading to a peak of ~ 10000 Tritium Units in rainwater. 
Some rainwater infiltrates into the ground and feeds the aquifers as groundwater recharge. The residence time of a groundwater after infiltration can be
calulated from the ratio of the remaining Tritium and enriched Helium in a groundwater sample. The calulated age is an approximation only, as the 
hydrodynamic dispersion leads to some groundwater age bias, especially around the Bomb-Peak.

The here presented 2D-vertical cross-section model of an Aquifer simulates the process in a very simplified manner. The model assumes a homogeneous aquifer with a 
constant groundwater recharge over space and time. It compares the Tritium - Helium age and the so called piston-flow age (which assumes no dispersion) in the aquifer,
as well es the resulting mixing age in a groundater sample, taken from a montitoring well of specfic poistion and screen length.

The model is purely based on analytical solutions that describe the travel times and flow paths in an unconfined aquifer 
(Chesneaux and Allen, 2008; Greskowiak et al., 2012), as well as advective-dispersive-reactive transport (Kinzelbach, 1987) 
considering a time varying boundary condition based on the superposition principle ().
